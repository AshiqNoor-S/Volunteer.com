## Web Flow
- Citizen’s and NGO’s can register/login into the website by giving basic details.
- Users can report issues by providing key details like description, location, and a picture.
- Based on the location of the porblem near by NGOs name will be fetched use an API.
- Once we have the list of the NGOs we will match the NGOs name with the ones which are available in our database.
- NGO’s whose data(Email) is available in our database will be notified about the problem raised by the user through an email using another API

In this way a connectivity between Users and NGO's will be created with the help of this platform.
